Set origin and destination by selecting text and using the context menu.  I wanted to have it so if you set the origin and/or destination,
it would auto populate the text fields in the browser action popup the next time you click it.

So basically, when the browser action icon is clicked, check the howFar object in eventpage.js to see if the origin and destination are blank.  
If origin isn't blank, set the origin input's value to howFar.origin, and the same for the destination.

This would have been easy using browserAction.onClicked.addListener(onBrowserActionClicked) in the event page, but apparently if the browser 
action has a popup, the onClicked for browserAction won't get called at all, so I have to find a way to detect when the browser action is 
clicked, then set the origin and destination like I described above.
